* D is the treat variable
* Y is the outcome of interest
* Z is the instrument
* X is 

* to find complier means
gen D_comp = 1 - D
gen YD_comp = Y*(1-D)

* beta is complier mean for outcome of interest
*   should add in control variables, fixed effects, and clusters as needed
ivreghdfe YD_comp (D_comp = Z) X


* if continuous...
*   need kappa weighting
reghdfe Z X, predict(pZ)
gen k = 1 - D(1-Z)/(1-pZ) - (1-D)*Z/pZ
sum X1 [aw = k]
